# github-actions

**NOTE:** This is a public repository, so do not store any sensitive information here.

Repository for storing reusable GitHub Actions workflows and actions.

Actions need to be tagged with a version number, e.g. `v1.0.0`. This is done by creating a new release in GitHub. The version number is used in the workflow files to reference the action.

You can use the `tag.sh` and `delete-tag.sh` files to make it easier for deploying.
